    "\n",
    "This notebook builds the **firm-level regression panel** used in the\n",
    "Glasserman-style news regressions. The goal is to take the S&P-500\n",
    "universe produced by the entity resolution pipeline, pull **fundamentals** and\n",
    "**daily prices** from EODHD for those firms, and construct a panel of returns\n",
    "and control variables (size, value, volatility, momentum). These controls are\n",
    "used to show that any incremental predictability from LDA-based news signals\n",
    "is **not** simply a relabeling of standard risk factors or simple firm\n",
    "characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is split into four stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Universe construction and fundamentals ingestion**\n",
    "   - Start from the `ticker_cik_mapping` universe of S&P-500 episodes that\n",
    "     actually appear in the news corpus.\n",
    "   - Drop a small set of problematic ticker–window episodes based on\n",
    "     `fundamentals_manual_adjudication` and `FIRMS_TO_DROP`.\n",
    "   - For the remaining episodes, call the EODHD **fundamentals** endpoint to\n",
    "     obtain quarterly balance-sheet snapshots and basic share-count data.\n",
    "2. **Daily price panel and return decomposition**\n",
    "   - For the same universe, call the EODHD **/eod** endpoint to obtain daily\n",
    "     OHLCV data over each ticker’s validity window.\n",
    "   - Decompose prices into overnight, intraday, and close-to-close log returns.\n",
    "3. **Feature construction (size, value, volatility, momentum)**\n",
    "   - Align quarterly fundamentals to trading days via a backward merge-as-of\n",
    "     with a 90-day tolerance.\n",
    "   - Compute market capitalization, log size, book-to-market, realized\n",
    "     volatility, and 1- and 12-month momentum, all with strict no-look-ahead.\n",
    "4. **Persistence to Postgres**\n",
    "   - Load the final `features_df` into the `equity_regression_panel` table,\n",
    "     keyed by `(cik, eodhd_symbol, trading_day)`, to serve as the regression\n",
    "     join point against LDA topic exposures and other signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Fundamentals ingestion and firm-level controls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Vendor fundamentals feed\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 1 focuses on **quarterly fundamentals** from EODHD and on making those\n",
    "snapshots usable as regression controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each active ticker–CIK–validity-window episode in `ticker_cik_mapping`\n",
    "  that survives the drop list, we construct an EODHD symbol (e.g. `AAPL.US`)\n",
    "  using `TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING` for historical renames.\n",
    "- We query the EODHD **fundamentals** endpoint with\n",
    "\n",
    "  `filter=Financials::Balance_Sheet::quarterly`\n",
    "\n",
    "  so that the JSON payload is limited to **quarterly balance-sheet data** and\n",
    "  a small set of share-count fields.\n",
    "- From each quarterly record we extract:\n",
    "  - `filing_date` – the normalized filing date of the report.\n",
    "  - `totalAssets` and `totalLiab` – used to construct\n",
    "    **book equity** as `totalAssets − totalLiab` when both are present.\n",
    "  - `commonStockSharesOutstanding` – used as **shares outstanding**.\n",
    "- We keep only filings whose `filing_date` lies inside the ticker’s\n",
    "  validity window `[start, end)`. Filings with a missing `filing_date` are\n",
    "  dropped with a logged warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These per-filing rows form the `fundamentals_df` used later when we align\n",
    "fundamentals to trading days and build the controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market capitalization** is defined as `adjusted_close × shares_outstanding`.\n",
    "- **Log size** is `log(market_cap)`.\n",
    "- **Book-to-market** is `book_equity / market_cap` when both inputs are\n",
    "  available.\n",
    "- All of these are evaluated **as of** each trading day using the latest\n",
    "  filing at or before that date, with a 90-day window, to avoid leaking\n",
    "  future fundamentals into the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Dropped and aliased ticker–window episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every ticker–CIK episode is usable for fundamentals-based controls. Before\n",
    "we call EODHD, the notebook applies the curated decisions recorded in\n",
    "`fundamentals_manual_adjudication` and encoded in `FIRMS_TO_DROP` and\n",
    "`TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING`. This ensures that the regression panel only includes\n",
    "episodes where we can defend the fundamentals data on an **as-of** basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main patterns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing or unusable fundamentals (drop_ticker).**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some ticker–window–CIK episodes have no usable quarterly fundamentals: the\n",
    "  EODHD endpoint either returns no data or returns payloads with missing\n",
    "  `filing_date`, making point-in-time validation impossible. These episodes are\n",
    "  recorded in `fundamentals_manual_adjudication` with `action = 'drop_ticker'`\n",
    "  and the ticker is added to `FIRMS_TO_DROP`, so the notebook removes them\n",
    "  from `active_firms` before any API calls are made.   \n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **YHOO — no usable filing dates.**  \n",
    "    For the `[2016-08-01, 2017-06-19)` episode, the EODHD fundamentals\n",
    "    endpoint returns balance-sheet data but without `filing_date`. Because we\n",
    "    cannot align these records to trading days or confirm that they fall inside\n",
    "    the validity window, the ticker is dropped from the regression universe for\n",
    "    this horizon (`action = 'drop_ticker'` with a rationale documenting the\n",
    "    missing filing dates).\n",
    "  - **CA — no fundamentals returned.**  \n",
    "    For ticker `CA` in `[2016-08-01, 2018-11-06)`, the EODHD fundamentals\n",
    "    endpoint returns no usable data at all. Rather than silently carrying a\n",
    "    firm with structurally missing controls, the episode is explicitly\n",
    "    adjudicated as `drop_ticker` and added to `FIRMS_TO_DROP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ticker-level aliases where the issuer is unchanged (alias_rewrite).**\n",
    "\n",
    "  In other cases the underlying issuer is well-identified, but the exchange\n",
    "  ticker has changed while the CIK remains the same. These are treated as\n",
    "  **aliases**, not distinct firms. The adjudication table records them with\n",
    "  `action = 'alias_rewrite'`, and the ticker-normalization logic rewrites the\n",
    "  historical symbol to a canonical one via `TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING` before\n",
    "  hitting EODHD.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **LB → BBWI — symbol change without issuer change.**  \n",
    "    For `LB` in `[2016-08-01, 2021-08-03)`, EDGAR and contemporaneous filings\n",
    "    show that the economic issuer continues as Bath & Body Works after the\n",
    "    separation from Victoria’s Secret. Fundamentals are more reliably served\n",
    "    under the `BBWI` symbol, so the adjudication row records an\n",
    "    `alias_rewrite` with a supporting 8-K, and `TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING` maps\n",
    "    `LB → BBWI` before querying EODHD. The regression panel therefore carries a\n",
    "    continuous `BBWI.US` time series and does not double-count the same CIK\n",
    "    under two tickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By enforcing these drop and alias decisions upstream, Stage 1 guarantees that\n",
    "every firm–ticker episode that survives into `fundamentals_df` has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a defensible issuer identity (via the ticker→CIK mapping and adjudication),\n",
    "- a usable stream of quarterly fundamentals with filing dates, and\n",
    "- a well-defined canonical vendor symbol for EODHD.\n",
    "\n",
    "That, in turn, makes the later regression results easier to interpret: when we\n",
    "say “book-to-market” or “size” for a firm-day, we know exactly **which**\n",
    "issuer, CIK, and ticker that control is referring to."
