    "# Firm-level regression features\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds the **firm-level regression panel** used in the\n",
    "Glasserman-style news regressions. The goal is to take the S&P-500\n",
    "universe produced by the entity resolution pipeline, pull **fundamentals** and\n",
    "**daily prices** from EODHD for those firms, and construct a panel of returns\n",
    "and control variables (size, value, volatility, momentum). These controls are\n",
    "used to show that any incremental predictability from LDA-based news signals\n",
    "is **not** simply a relabeling of standard risk factors or simple firm\n",
    "characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is split into four stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Universe construction and fundamentals ingestion**\n",
    "   - Start from the **full** `ticker_cik_mapping` universe of S&P-500 episodes.\n",
    "   - **Crucially**, we include all constituents regardless of news coverage. This ensures \"Phantom Firms\" (those with zero news) are retained, allowing for unbiased estimation of the \"extensive margin\" (probability of having *any* news) in the downstream Heckman selection model.\n",
    "   - Drop a small set of problematic ticker–window episodes based on `fundamentals_manual_adjudication` and `FIRMS_TO_DROP`.\n",
    "   - For the remaining episodes, call the EODHD **fundamentals** endpoint to obtain quarterly balance-sheet snapshots and basic share-count data.\n",
    "2. **Daily price panel and return decomposition**\n",
    "   - For the same unconditional universe, call the EODHD **/eod** endpoint to obtain daily OHLCV data over each ticker’s validity window.\n",
    "   - Decompose prices into overnight, intraday, and close-to-close log returns.\n",
    "3. **Feature construction (size, value, volatility, momentum)**\n",
    "   - Align quarterly fundamentals to trading days via a backward merge-as-of with a 90-day tolerance.\n",
    "   - Compute market capitalization, log size, book-to-market, realized volatility, and 1- and 12-month momentum, all with strict no-look-ahead.\n",
    "4. **Persistence to Postgres**\n",
    "   - Load the final `features_df` into the `equity_regression_panel` table, keyed by `(cik, eodhd_symbol, trading_day)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Fundamentals ingestion and firm-level controls\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Vendor fundamentals feed\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 1 focuses on **quarterly fundamentals** from EODHD and on making those\n",
    "snapshots usable as regression controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each ticker–CIK–validity-window episode in `ticker_cik_mapping`\n",
    "  that survives the drop list, we construct an EODHD symbol (e.g. `AAPL.US`)\n",
    "  using `TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING` for historical renames.\n",
    "- **Note on Universe Definition:** We do not filter for firms present in the news corpus. We query the full index constituency. This is required to capture the \"true zeros\" for the selection equation.\n",
    "- We query the EODHD **fundamentals** endpoint with\n",
    "\n",
    "  `filter=Financials::Balance_Sheet::quarterly`\n",
    "\n",
    "  so that the JSON payload is limited to **quarterly balance-sheet data** and\n",
    "  a small set of share-count fields.\n",
    "- From each quarterly record we extract:\n",
    "  - `filing_date` – the normalized filing date of the report.\n",
    "  - `totalAssets` and `totalLiab` – used to construct\n",
    "    **book equity** as `totalAssets − totalLiab` when both are present.\n",
    "  - `commonStockSharesOutstanding` – used as **shares outstanding**.\n",
    "- We keep only filings whose `filing_date` lies inside the ticker’s\n",
    "  validity window `[start, end)`. Filings with a missing `filing_date` are\n",
    "  dropped with a logged warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "These per-filing rows form the `fundamentals_df` used later when we align\n",
    "fundamentals to trading days and build the controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market capitalization** is defined as `adjusted_close × shares_outstanding`.\n",
    "- **Log size** is `log(market_cap)`.\n",
    "- **Book-to-market** is `book_equity / market_cap` when both inputs are\n",
    "  available.\n",
    "- All of these are evaluated **as of** each trading day using the latest\n",
    "  filing at or before that date, with a 90-day window, to avoid leaking\n",
    "  future fundamentals into the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Dropped and aliased ticker–window episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every ticker–CIK episode is usable for fundamentals-based controls. Before\n",
    "we call EODHD, the notebook applies the curated decisions recorded in\n",
    "`fundamentals_manual_adjudication` and encoded in `FIRMS_TO_DROP` and\n",
    "`TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Distinction on Attrition:**\n",
    "We strictly distinguish between **measurement error** (which we drop) and **structural silence** (which we keep).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Retained: \"Phantom Firms\" (Zero News).**\n",
    "    Firms that exist in the S&P 500 but have *zero* news articles during the sample period are **not** dropped. These observations are statistically vital. They represent the $N=0$ outcome in the selection model. Dropping them would induce selection bias (truncation based on the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Dropped: Unusable Data.**\n",
    "    We only drop episodes where we cannot defend the fundamentals data on an **as-of** basis. The main patterns for dropping are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing or unusable fundamentals (drop_ticker).**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some ticker–window–CIK episodes have no usable quarterly fundamentals: the\n",
    "  EODHD endpoint either returns no data or returns payloads with missing\n",
    "  `filing_date`, making point-in-time validation impossible. These episodes are\n",
    "  recorded in `fundamentals_manual_adjudication` with `action = 'drop_ticker'`\n",
    "  and the ticker is added to `FIRMS_TO_DROP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - **YHOO — no usable filing dates.** (Unable to align to trading days).\n",
    "  - **CA — no fundamentals returned.** (Structurally missing controls).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ticker-level aliases where the issuer is unchanged (alias_rewrite).**\n",
    "\n",
    "  In other cases the underlying issuer is well-identified, but the exchange\n",
    "  ticker has changed while the CIK remains the same. These are treated as\n",
    "  **aliases**, not distinct firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  - **LB → BBWI.** `TICKER_ALIAS_MAPPING` maps `LB → BBWI` before querying EODHD. The regression panel carries a continuous `BBWI.US` time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "By enforcing these drop decisions—while strictly retaining the \"quiet\" firms—Stage 1 guarantees that the panel is representative of the full index universe, not just the \"noisy\" subset.\n"
