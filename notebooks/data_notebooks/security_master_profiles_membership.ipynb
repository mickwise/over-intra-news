    "# Security master, profile history, and S&P 500 membership\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-candidate adjudication notebook produces a curated `ticker_cik_mapping` table with exactly one primary CIK per `(ticker, validity_window)` in the S&P 500 universe. This notebook builds on that output to construct three canonical, CIK-keyed layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **security master** that defines the firm-level entity registry.\n",
    "2. An **episodic profile history** that records company names (and lightweight descriptors) over time.\n",
    "3. A **daily S&P 500 membership panel** that asserts index inclusion per CIK and trading day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these tables decouple firm identity, naming history, and index membership from noisy upstream sources (filings, snapshots, CSV feeds) and provide stable anchors for downstream research datasets such as prices, fundamentals, and news-returns alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three layers are keyed by the SEC Central Index Key (CIK), stored as a 10-digit zero-padded text string. Time-varying attributes use half-open date ranges `[start, end)` with explicit validity windows to support as-of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Scope and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is responsible for the following warehouse tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`security_master`**  \n",
    "  Entity registry keyed by CIK. Exactly one row per firm in the research universe. No validity windows; all time-varying attributes live downstream.  \n",
    "  **Output:** a populated `security_master` table containing every CIK that appears in `ticker_cik_mapping` (plus any additional CIKs that are needed for completeness).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`security_profile_history`**  \n",
    "  Episodic profile table keyed by `(cik, validity_window)`. Stores company names (and optional lightweight descriptors) with explicit half-open `[start, end)` date ranges and non-overlap constraints per CIK.  \n",
    "  **Output:** a set of non-overlapping name episodes per CIK, each with a canonical `company_name`, `source`, and a representative `evidence_id` for provenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`snp_membership`**  \n",
    "  Daily S&P 500 membership panel keyed by `(cik, trading_day)`. Presence of a row implies that the firm was in the index on that NYSE trading day.  \n",
    "  **Output:** a dense panel of `(cik, trading_day)` membership assertions derived by combining ticker-level S&P 500 snapshots with the curated `ticker_cik_mapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook encodes simple, deterministic rules for each layer and reserves a small, explicit manual surface (where necessary) for name conflicts and corner cases. Sanity checks at the end verify row counts and coverage of the S&P 500 universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Inputs and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes the following upstream tables and artifacts are already available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ticker_cik_mapping`**  \n",
    "  Curated mapping from `(ticker, validity_window)` to a unique primary CIK, as produced by the multi-candidate adjudication notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ticker_cik_evidence`**  \n",
    "  Evidence table keyed by `evidence_id` containing per-filing metadata (including CIK, filing dates, and company names) used to derive profile episodes and provenance links.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Daily S&P 500 membership snapshots**  \n",
    "  Ticker-level index membership inputs (e.g., derived from the GitHub repository https://github.com/fja05680/sp500) that can be joined to the trading calendar and to `ticker_cik_mapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`trading_calendar`**  \n",
    "  Canonical NYSE trading calendar providing the set of valid `trading_day` values and supporting date-range joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections that follow construct each of the three target tables in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Populate `security_master` from the curated CIK universe.\n",
    "2. Derive and adjudicate `security_profile_history` episodes using evidence-backed company names.\n",
    "3. Build `snp_membership` by combining daily ticker-level S&P snapshots with `ticker_cik_mapping` and the trading calendar, followed by basic consistency checks.\n"

    "## 2. Security master\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The `security_master` table is the canonical entity registry for the research universe. It defines the set of firm-level entities as identified by SEC Central Index Keys (CIKs) and provides the anchor key that downstream episodic tables use for as-of logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ticker_cik_mapping` records which CIK is associated with a given `(ticker, validity_window)`.\n",
    "- `security_profile_history` stores name history episodes per CIK.\n",
    "- `snp_membership` records daily S&P 500 inclusion per CIK and trading day.\n",
    "- Price, fundamentals, and news-linking layers are expected to key on CIK as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "By construction, `security_master` is intentionally minimal: it stores only the CIK itself and enforces a format constraint. All time-varying and descriptive attributes live in separate, windowed tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Table definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The table is defined once in the warehouse and reused across all downstream pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Canonical entity registry keyed by SEC CIK\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_master (\n",
    "\n",
    "        -- CIK as the primary key (10-digit zero-padded string)\n",
    "        cik TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "\n",
    "        -- Ensure CIK is numeric and zero-padded to 10 digits\n",
    "        CONSTRAINT cik_numeric_and_padded CHECK (cik ~ '^[0-9]{10}$')\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "    COMMENT ON TABLE security_master IS\n",
    "    'Core reference table: one row per security in the research universe.';\n",
    "\n",
    "    COMMENT ON COLUMN security_master.cik IS\n",
    "    'Central Index Key (CIK), 10-digit zero-padded string, primary key';\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary key:** `cik` (TEXT) — exactly one row per 10-digit, zero-padded CIK.\n",
    "- **Format constraint:** a CHECK enforces `^[0-9]{10}$`, ruling out malformed or non-padded keys.\n",
    "- **No timestamps or validity windows:** lineage and timing live in episodic tables such as `security_profile_history`, `ticker_cik_mapping`, and `snp_membership`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Population strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `security_master` table is populated from the curated CIK universe produced upstream:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The primary source is **`ticker_cik_mapping`**, which already encodes the resolved `(ticker, validity_window) → CIK` relationships for the S&P 500 research universe.\n",
    "- Optionally, additional CIKs can be unioned in from evidence tables (e.g., `ticker_cik_evidence`) if there is a need to extend the entity registry beyond the S&P 500 constituents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population logic is intentionally simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Derive the CIK universe**  \n",
    "   - Take the set of distinct CIKs appearing in `ticker_cik_mapping`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert into `security_master`**  \n",
    "   - Insert the derived CIK set into `security_master`.  \n",
    "   - The operation should be **idempotent**: re-running it should not change existing rows, only add new CIKs if they appear in the upstream sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sanity checks**  \n",
    "   - Verify that every CIK present in `ticker_cik_mapping` now has a corresponding row in `security_master`.  \n",
    "   - Confirm that the CIK format constraint holds (any malformed CIKs will fail the CHECK and should be treated as upstream data-quality issues)."

    "## 3. Security profile history\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The `security_profile_history` table captures the **name history** of each firm in the research universe, keyed by SEC CIK. It provides a time-varying profile layer that can be joined as-of to prices, S&P 500 membership, and news, so that each historical record is labeled with the company name that was in effect at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this design, the CIK identifies the legal entity, and `security_profile_history` records how that entity is described over time. This makes it possible to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attach a canonical company name to each `(cik, trading_day)` when building daily panels.\n",
    "- Handle corporate rebrands and legal name changes (e.g., “Facebook, Inc.” → “Meta Platforms, Inc.”) via explicit, dated episodes.\n",
    "- Keep the name layer separate from tickers and index membership, which have their own episodic tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Table definition and semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "The table is defined once in the warehouse (see `security_profile_history.sql`) with the following key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary key:** `(cik, validity_window)`  \n",
    "  Each row represents a single **name episode** for one CIK over a half-open date span `[start, end)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-overlap per CIK:**  \n",
    "  A GiST exclusion constraint enforces that `validity_window` ranges may **not overlap for the same CIK**. At any given date, a firm has at most one canonical name in this table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Half-open date ranges:**  \n",
    "  `validity_window` is a `DATERANGE` with `LOWER_INC = true` and `UPPER_INC = false`, non-empty and finite. As-of joins use predicates of the form  \n",
    "  `trading_day <@ validity_window` to attach the appropriate episode to each date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name and source constraints:**  \n",
    "  `company_name` is a trimmed, non-empty `TEXT` value. `source` is also a trimmed, non-empty `TEXT` value describing the origin of the profile data (e.g., “SEC 10-K parser”).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entity and provenance links:**  \n",
    "  - `cik` is a 10-digit, zero-padded text identifier and a foreign key to `security_master(cik)`.  \n",
    "  - `evidence_id` is a foreign key to `ticker_cik_evidence(evidence_id)` and serves as a representative provenance key for the episode (for example, a filing whose header contains the name in `company_name`).  \n",
    "  - `ingested_at` records when the profile episode was loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these constraints ensure that for any `(cik, date)` pair, there is either zero or one row in `security_profile_history`, and that row has a well-formed name and an explicit provenance trail back to the underlying evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Population strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The population of `security_profile_history` is driven by evidence about how companies are named in filings and other structured sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect candidate names per CIK**  \n",
    "   - Start from the curated CIK universe in `security_master` and the mapping in `ticker_cik_mapping`.  \n",
    "   - For each CIK, gather the set of names and filing dates from `ticker_cik_evidence` (or other profile sources) that are deemed reliable for naming (e.g., 10-K/20-F headers, selected 8-K items).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalize and cluster names**  \n",
    "   - Apply deterministic normalization (e.g., trimming whitespace, standardizing capitalization, optionally normalizing corporate designators like “Inc.” vs “Incorporated”).  \n",
    "   - Group records by `(cik, normalized_name)` to identify clusters of evidence supporting the same underlying name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Propose episodes and resolve conflicts**  \n",
    "   - For each `(cik, normalized_name)` cluster, derive a candidate `validity_window` from the earliest to the latest supporting date, using half-open `[start, end)` semantics.  \n",
    "   - For CIKs with multiple candidate names whose windows overlap or interleave, perform a small amount of manual review to distinguish true legal name changes from formatting noise. This review results in a set of **non-overlapping episodes** per CIK, each with a chosen `company_name`, `validity_window`, `source`, and `evidence_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Insert episodes into `security_profile_history`**  \n",
    "   - Insert the final, non-overlapping episodes per CIK into `security_profile_history`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Interpretation of name changes and splits\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporate rebrands and legal name changes are represented by **multiple episodes for the same CIK** with different names and adjacent, non-overlapping `validity_window`s. For example, a transition from “Facebook, Inc.” to “Meta Platforms, Inc.” is modeled as two distinct rows for the same CIK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One episode covering dates where the legacy name is in effect.\n",
    "- A subsequent episode covering dates where the new name is in effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach keeps `security_profile_history` focused on a single **canonical name per CIK at any point in time**, while still capturing the full history of legal names needed for as-of labeling and downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Sanity checks\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing `security_profile_history`, the notebook performs basic consistency checks, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every CIK in `security_master` that appears in downstream panels (e.g., S&P 500 membership) has at least one profile episode or is explicitly known to have no reliable naming data in the horizon of interest.  \n",
    "- No two rows for the same CIK have overlapping `validity_window`s.  \n",
    "- Each profile episode has a non-empty `company_name`, a non-empty `source`, and a valid `evidence_id` that links back to `ticker_cik_evidence`."

    "   - Convert the string to upper-case.\n",
    "   - Strip leading and trailing whitespace.\n",

    "2. **Strip lightweight punctuation**\n",

    "   - Remove commas, ampersands, hyphens, forward slashes, and periods\n",
