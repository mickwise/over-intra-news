    "# 1 Ticker → CIK Mapping with High-Signal SEC Filings\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this notebook is to produce a curated `ticker_cik_mapping` table with exactly one primary CIK per `(ticker, validity_window)` episode in the S&P 500 universe.\n",
    "- Evidence is restricted to a high-precision subset of EDGAR filings (periodic reports and a curated slice of 8-K items), plus pre-derived Wayback-based S&P 500 membership windows.\n",
    "- Simple auto-accept rules based on periodic coverage resolve the vast majority of episodes; a residual set of ambiguous cases is handed off to manual adjudication and recorded in `ticker_cik_manual_adjudication`.\n",
    "- The final mapping is fully auditable: each manual decision stores a rationale, sources, and a representative `evidence_id` (or sentinel) linking back to the underlying evidence tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Background and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds the time-varying map from S&P 500 tickers to SEC Central Index Key (CIK) identifiers that are needed in order to faithfully recreate\n",
    "'Does Overnight News Explain Overnight Returns?' (Glasserman, Krstovski, Laliberte and Mamaysky July 2025). Their paper works with CRSP index membership and commercial security master data; This pipeline tries to recreate the same object using only public sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GitHub repository https://github.com/fja05680/sp500 is used to create *ticker*-based S&P 500 constituency windows.\n",
    "- Candidate CIKs are then seeded into the pipeline by scraping the WayBack machine's snapshots of the Wikipedia page: \"List of S&P 500 companies\"<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)</sup> that lie within each ticker constituency windows.\n",
    "- Evidence is gathered in the form of SEC EDGAR filings to identify which legal entity (CIK) underlies each (ticker, validity_window) episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is a research-grade firm panel that matches the spirit of the original paper—firm-level news exposures and return decompositions—without relying on proprietary security master or index-constituent datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central challenge is entity resolution. For many S&P 500 episodes there is a unique, obvious issuer CIK; for others, EDGAR presents several plausible candidates (parent vs. subsidiary, pre- and post-merger entities, or stray CIKs that only appear in ownership filings). In an earlier attempt a very broad filing set was used, pulling in almost any form that mentioned the ticker. That approach produced a large, noisy evidence table and too many ambiguous (ticker, window, candidate_cik) triples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is restarted from a much smaller, high-signal evidence set, focusing only on filing types that reliably anchor the identity of the listed operating company.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Evidence set and “eligible” form types\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `ticker_cik_evidence` denote the table of candidate links between a ticker, a validity window, and a CIK, together with the filings that support each link. In its current iteration, this table only contains form types out of the following restricted set to answer the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Which legal entity was the actual listed issuer for ticker X in window [start, end)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The eligible forms fall into two buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Periodic reports (ongoing issuer identity)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the backbone of the evidence set. They are long-form financial reports that can only be filed by the registrant itself, and they typically restate the legal name, state/country of incorporation, and exchange listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Form 10-K / 10-K/A / 10-KT – Annual reports of U.S. issuers. See the SEC’s description of Form 10-K: <sup>[2](https://www.sec.gov/forms/10-k)</sup>\n",
    "- Form 10-Q / 10-Q/A / 10-QT – Quarterly reports of U.S. issuers. See Form 10-Q: <sup>[3](https://www.sec.gov/forms/10-q)</sup>\n",
    "- Form 20-F / 20-F/A – Annual reports for foreign private issuers, often the right anchor when the S&P 500 constituent is a non-U.S. company listed via ordinary shares or ADRs. See Form 20-F: <sup>[4](https://www.sec.gov/forms/20-f)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code these drive a boolean feature\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```text\n",
    "    has_periodic := form_type ∈ {\n",
    "        10-K, 10-KT, 10-K/A,\n",
    "        10-Q, 10-QT, 10-Q/A,\n",
    "        20-F, 20-F/A\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the main signal for “this CIK is behaving like the actual issuer over this window.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected 8-K current reports (mid-window structural changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Form 8-K is a short “current report” used to disclose material events between periodic reports.<sup>[5](https://www.sec.gov/forms/8-k)</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most 8-Ks are about earnings releases or routine updates and are not useful for identity. Therefore only 8-Ks whose item codes indicate a structural change in the security or issuer that could cause a mid-window split, ticker change, or change in the underlying legal entity are ingested as evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, the eligible 8-K items are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Item 1.01 – Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement (often merger agreements, significant asset purchases/sales, or credit facilities that precede a reorganization).\n",
    "- Item 2.01 – Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets (used when a merger or major asset acquisition closes and the surviving registrant is identified).\n",
    "- Item 3.03 – Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders (captures changes in share classes, voting rights, or similar corporate actions).\n",
    "- Item 5.01 – Changes in Control of Registrant.\n",
    "- Item 5.03 – Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.\n",
    "\n",
    "These items tend to say things like “Company A merged with Company B, with Company B as the surviving corporation,” or “the registrant’s common stock began trading under the new ticker XYZ on the New York Stock Exchange.” Those statements are exactly what is needed to decide whether a CIK should own the full S&P 500 window or whether the window must be split around a corporate event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationally, the evidence pipeline now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ingests periodic reports and a small, curated subset of 8-Ks with one or more of the above items.\n",
    "2. Discards all other form types (13D/G, proxy statements, shelf registrations, etc.) for the purpose of issuer identity, even though they are still available in EDGAR.\n",
    "3. Computes features like `has_periodic` per (ticker, validity_window, candidate_cik) group to support deterministic auto-accept rules later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimmed evidence set dramatically reduces noise while still retaining the filings that actually state who the registrant is and when that identity changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Manual adjudication and the ticker_cik_manual_adjudication table\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the refined form set, some (ticker, validity_window) pairs remain ambiguous:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Wayback-scraped S&P 500 table sometimes picks up stray CIKs that belong to insiders or completely unrelated micro-cap issuers.\n",
    "- Corporate restructurings can produce pairs of closely related CIKs (e.g., pre- and post-inversion entities) that both have legitimate filings in or near the window.\n",
    "- A few candidates have no in-window eligible filings at all (for example, a defunct issuer that only files a revocation order years later).\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases the underlying EDGAR filings and contemporaneous Wayback snapshots were reviewed and the result was recorded in a dedicated adjudication table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    ticker_cik_manual_adjudication(\n",
    "        ticker           TEXT,\n",
    "        validity_window  DATERANGE,\n",
    "        associated_cik   TEXT,   -- 10-digit CIK this decision is about\n",
    "        action           TEXT,   -- e.g. 'manual_override'\n",
    "        rationale        TEXT,   -- human-readable explanation\n",
    "        sources          TEXT[], -- EDGAR / Wayback URLs\n",
    "        evidence_id      BIGINT  -- optional pointer back into ticker_cik_evidence\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `action` column encodes a small, fixed set of decision types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `seed_with_cik` – seed a `(ticker, validity_window)` episode with an explicit `associated_cik` when automated harvesting is ambiguous or incomplete.\n",
    "- `manual_override` – override a candidates validity for a specific `(ticker, validity_window, associated_cik)` triple (e.g., force-include or force-exclude a candidate CIK based on external evidence).\n",
    "- `window_split` – split a coarse S&P 500 validity window into multiple sub-windows, each tied to a different `associated_cik`.\n",
    "- `alias_rewrite` – record ticker-level alias rewrites (symbol changes where the underlying issuer does not change); in this case `associated_cik` is `NULL` by construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These actions form a small state machine for tricky episodes and provide a stable surface for downstream consumers to reason about manual decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- JKHY — spurious insider CIK.  \n",
    "  Wikipedia snapshots briefly listed Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY) with CIK 0001262439, but EDGAR shows that CIK only as a Form 4 / Schedule 13D filer in the mid-2000s, never as the issuer of 10-K/10-Q/8-K/registration forms. The actual S&P 500 issuer is CIK 0000779152. A `manual_override` row for 0001262439 was recorded, with a rationale explaining that it is an insider identifier that should be excluded from the mapping in this window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AOS — unrelated micro-cap issuer.  \n",
    "  For ticker AOS the Wayback data produced a candidate 0001391407, which EDGAR identifies as BIOFUELS POWER CORP. Its only filing in the relevant horizon is a “REVOKED” order revoking registration for failure to file periodic reports; there is no evidence linking it to A. O. Smith Corp (CIK 0000091142) or to any S&P 500 listing. Here the manual override explicitly marks 0001391407 as a stray candidate to be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MYL — Mylan Inc. vs. Mylan N.V.  \n",
    "  For ticker MYL in [2016-08-01, 2020-11-17) the candidates are Mylan Inc. (0000069499) and Mylan N.V. (0001623613). Pre-window registration filings and 8-K correspondence show the corporate reorganization in which Mylan N.V. becomes the primary issuer, with Mylan Inc. acting as a guarantor. Within the window, the periodic reports are consistently filed under 0001623613, so the manual decision is to treat Mylan N.V. as the operating issuer for this S&P 500 episode and to treat Inc. as a related but non-primary entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is that ticker_cik_manual_adjudication is not the final mapping itself. Instead, it encodes exceptions and curated decisions to be applied when deterministic rules are silent or misleading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some rows exclude a candidate CIK as clearly spurious.\n",
    "- Others alias or mark a true window split when sufficient evidence is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Downstream, the mapping algorithm treats any (ticker, validity_window, associated_cik) triple with `action = 'manual_override'` as already adjudicated and removes it from the pool of candidates that need to be ranked or resolved automatically. This keeps the final ticker → CIK map auditable: every non-obvious decision is backed either by an explicit rule or by a short, human-readable rationale and a list of source documents.\n"

    "## 3 Manual adjudication of remaining ticker–CIK pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Residual set after auto-accept rules\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying the two auto-accept rules from §2 and stitching in previously\n",
    "adjudicated seeds from `ticker_cik_manual_adjudication`, there remain\n",
    "**17** unresolved `(ticker, validity_window)` pairs. These are exactly the\n",
    "rows shown in the table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "By construction, this residual set is the part of the universe where the\n",
    "automatic logic is either *uninformative* or *potentially misleading*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For these pairs, the high-signal evidence set (periodic forms) does **not** produce a unique, obviously correct issuer.\n",
    "- In particular, Rules 1 and 2 cannot safely pick a single `candidate_cik`\n",
    "  based only on in-window periodic filings, even though the evidence table\n",
    "  is otherwise complete for the run horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intentional: the auto-accept rules are deliberately conservative, so\n",
    "that clear cases are resolved mechanically and the remaining, genuinely\n",
    "ambiguous episodes are escalated to manual review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Two main ambiguity patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, the 17 unresolved pairs fall into two structural patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-candidate, no-periodic**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For a given `(ticker, validity_window)`, there is exactly one\n",
    "     `candidate_cik` in `ticker_cik_evidence`.\n",
    "   - However, this candidate has **no in-window periodic filings** in the\n",
    "     restricted set  \n",
    "     (`10-K`, `10-KT`, `10-K/A`, `10-Q`, `10-QT`, `10-Q/A`, `20-F`,\n",
    "     `20-F/A`), i.e. `has_periodic = False` for that triple.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This can arise for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The S&P 500 **validity window is very short** (for example, a late\n",
    "     addition followed by a merger or deletion), so the nearest 10-K/10-Q/20-F\n",
    "     lies just outside the window.\n",
    "   - The issuer was already public and fully reporting, but its last periodic\n",
    "     report **predates the start** of the S&P window and no new periodic\n",
    "     report is filed before the constituent is removed.\n",
    "   - A structural or listing event is disclosed via an 8-K or registration\n",
    "     statement, but that specific filing type is not part of the high-signal\n",
    "     evidence set used to drive `has_periodic`.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - A **true issuer succession or split** inside the coarse S&P 500 window  \n",
    "     (e.g., pre- and post-merger entities, redomiciling from one jurisdiction\n",

    "\n",
    "For each of the 17 `(ticker, validity_window)` pairs in this residual set,\n",
    "the workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspect all evidence rows** for that (ticker, window): list all\n",
    "   `candidate_cik` values, their `has_periodic` flags, and the full set of\n",
    "   in-window filings (form types, `filed_at`, company names).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For **single-candidate, no-periodic** cases:\n",
    "   - Look just **outside the window** (immediately pre- and post-window\n",
    "     10-K/10-Q/20-F filings) to confirm continuity of the legal entity.\n",
    "   - Cross-check contemporaneous **S&P 500 documentation** (Wayback\n",
    "     snapshots and index changes) to ensure the ticker–CIK association is not\n",
    "     spurious.\n",
    "   - If the evidence is consistent, record a `seed_with_cik` decision in\n",
    "     `ticker_cik_manual_adjudication`, with a short rationale and URLs to the\n",
    "     supporting filings and S&P references.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For **multi-candidate, multi-periodic** cases:\n",
    "   - Read the relevant **structural filings** (8-Ks with Items 1.01, 2.01,\n",
    "     3.03, 5.01, 5.03; registration statements; cross-referenced 10-K/20-F\n",
    "     sections) to determine whether there is:\n",
    "     - a genuine **window split** (the ticker migrates from one CIK to\n",
    "       another mid-window), or\n",
    "     - a **primary vs. non-primary** relationship (one CIK is consistently\n",
    "       described as the listed issuer; the other as guarantor, parent, or\n",
    "       subsidiary).\n",
    "   - Encode the outcome in `ticker_cik_manual_adjudication` using\n",
    "     `manual_override` or `window_split`,\n",
    "     again with a short rationale and links to the key documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once these decisions are in place, the curated manual rows are treated as\n",
    "   **fixed constraints**: they are removed from any further automated\n",
    "   candidate ranking, and the final `ticker_cik_mapping` table can be built\n",
    "   by combining:\n",
    "   - auto-accepted mappings from §2, and\n",
    "   - manually adjudicated episodes from this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the final mapping is both **systematic** (driven by simple,\n",
    "transparent rules wherever possible) and **auditable** (every non-trivial\n",
    "decision is backed by explicit manual reasoning and traceable sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note on `MANUALLY_MAPPED_TICKERS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MANUALLY_MAPPED_TICKERS` is a small, hard-coded set of five edge-case tickers that were already resolved during the ingestion phase. For these symbols, the underlying issuer was known, but no usable periodic or curated 8-K evidence fell inside the S&P&nbsp;500 validity window, or the available filings were not legible for the purposes of this notebook. They are therefore treated as pre-mapped here and excluded from the residual candidate set."

    "- The input S&P 500 universe contributes **699** base `(ticker, validity_window)` episodes. During adjudication, **10** windows are split, yielding **709** distinct episodes in total.\n",
    "- The final `ticker_cik_mapping` table contains exactly **709** rows, so each episode is mapped to exactly one primary CIK.\n",
    "- By construction of the upstream tables, each `(ticker, validity_window)` has at most two candidate CIKs before adjudication. Combined with the row-count check above, this ensures that every episode is resolved to at least one and at most one primary mapping.\n",
    "- Apart from a small set of pre-seeded edge cases, every mapping row is either:\n",
    "  - accepted automatically under Rule&nbsp;1 or Rule&nbsp;2, or  \n",
    "  - backed by at least one decision recorded in `ticker_cik_manual_adjudication`.\n",
    "- A small group of “manually mapped” tickers is treated as resolved from the outset: these have known issuers but no usable periodic / curated 8-K evidence inside the validity window. Separately, **DDOG** and **GGP** are handled via explicit manual adjudication rows because no EDGAR filings fall inside their respective windows; for these, a sentinel `evidence_id` stands in for a concrete filing so that provenance remains explicit.\n",
