    "# Glasserman-style news regressions and topic persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes the fixed LDA topic model trained on CC-NEWS articles and links\n",
    "its firm-level topic exposure vectors to equity returns in a **Glasserman-style**\n",
    "framework. Conceptually we follow Glasserman–Krstovski–Laliberte–Mamaysky:\n",
    "topics are estimated once, exposure vectors are aggregated to the firm–period level,\n",
    "and regressions map lagged exposures and firm characteristics into intraday and\n",
    "overnight returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to the original paper, we make four deliberate changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different sample and rolling window.**  \n",
    "   4 different LDA models are trained once on CC-NEWS from 2016–2022 and then\n",
    "   used for inference on 2022–2025 to create a fully OOS time period.\n",
    "   Return regressions use a shorter equity sample than the original paper, so we work with **one-year\n",
    "   exposure windows** ($n = 1$) rather than four-year windows. With $n = 1$ the\n",
    "   \"rolling window\" becomes a single lag, which makes the panel explicitly\n",
    "   dynamic and preserves effective sample length.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Elastic Net instead of pure lasso.**  \n",
    "   Glasserman uses lasso to select a sparse set of predictive topics. Here we use\n",
    "   an **Elastic Net (EN) penalty** with mixing parameter $\\alpha_{\\text{EN}}$\n",
    "   close to one:\n",
    "   - the $\\ell_1$ component keeps the number of active topics manageable, and  \n",
    "   - the small $\\ell_2$ component stabilizes coefficients when topics are highly\n",
    "     collinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic panels with GMM and explicit selection correction.**  \n",
    "   Both the topic persistence regressions and the return regressions include\n",
    "   **lagged dependent variables** with unobserved firm, topic and/or time\n",
    "   heterogeneity. In Wooldridge’s language (Chapter 11), this puts us in the\n",
    "   world of **unobserved effects models under sequential moment restrictions**\n",
    "   rather than strict exogeneity. At the same time, our panel is **unbalanced**:\n",
    "   firms enter and exit the S&P 500 and, even for a given firm–topic pair,\n",
    "   some years have no relevant articles at all. Because the appearance of a\n",
    "   firm–topic cell in the panel is unlikely to be mean independent of the\n",
    "   idiosyncratic error, we do not treat missing cells as innocuous. Instead we\n",
    "   - model the observation indicator with a **first-stage probit selection\n",
    "     equation**, and\n",
    "   - feed the resulting **inverse Mills ratio** into the outcome equation as a\n",
    "     control function.  \n",
    "   We then estimate the augmented dynamic-panel outcome by **Arellano–Bond–style\n",
    "   GMM**, using lags of the dependent variable as instruments and treating the\n",
    "   selection-correction term as an additional (predetermined) regressor. Fixed\n",
    "   effects serve as a benchmark, but our main estimates are GMM-with-selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State-space smoothing of forecast coefficients.**  \n",
    "   With annual data we are in a **large-$N$, small-$T$** setting, so the year-by-year\n",
    "   EN–GMM estimates $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_t$ can be noisy. To hedge against this\n",
    "   small-$T$ instability, we place the coefficient vectors in a simple **state-space\n",
    "   model** (e.g. an AR(1) evolution for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_t$) and apply\n",
    "   **Kalman smoothing**. This produces smoothed paths\n",
    "   $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_t$ that borrow strength across adjacent years. We then\n",
    "   base portfolio construction on the smoothed $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_t$, with the\n",
    "   explicit goal of reducing forecast noise and **alleviating excessive turnover** while\n",
    "   still allowing for gradual structural change in the news–return relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the notebook is organised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Topic persistence.** Define firm–period topic exposure vectors and estimate\n",
    "   dynamic panel regressions of $t+1$ exposures on lagged exposures, using\n",
    "   GMM plus a Heckman-style selection correction to handle lagged dependent\n",
    "   variables and non-random observation of firm–topic–year cells.\n",
    "2. **Annual returns and characteristics.** Build firm-year panels of intraday and\n",
    "   overnight returns plus standard characteristics (size, value, momentum,\n",
    "   etc.).\n",
    "3. **Elastic-Net GMM return regressions.** Run Glasserman-style regressions of\n",
    "   annual intraday/overnight returns on lagged topic exposures and controls,\n",
    "   estimated by EN plus GMM (again with a selection correction),\n",
    "   and compare to FE benchmarks.\n",

    "2.  **Smart Initialization:** Recursions are initialized using the sample mean (`init=\"sample_mean\"`), placing starting parameters in a high-probability region of the likelihood surface.\n",
    "3.  **Robust Optimization:** We utilize the **Hager-Zhang** line search (which handles flat likelihood surfaces better than standard methods) and increase the L-BFGS memory history to 50 steps to better approximate curvature on difficult ridges.\n",

    "    For firm–sessions with at least 200 news events (approximating one trading year of activity), we fit the full EACD(1,1) model ($p=1, q=1$).\n",
    "    * This captures both short-term clustering ($\\alpha$) and long-term persistence ($\\beta$).\n",
    "    * **Justification:** While theoretical convergence requires larger samples, N=200 approximates the standard one-year lookback window (N=252) used in realized volatility estimation. Setting the threshold slightly below 252 allows for minor data gaps (e.g., holidays, quiet weeks) without excluding firms that effectively exhibit year-round activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Tier 2: Restricted Dynamics (EACD 1,0) for $50 \\le N < 200$.**\n",
    "    For moderately active firms, we fit a parsimonious **EACD(1,0)** model ($p=1, q=0$).\n",
    "    * This corresponds to an **ARCH(1)** structure, capturing volatility clustering via lagged durations but omitting the infinite memory term.\n",
    "    * **Justification:** In medium samples, estimating the persistence parameter $\\beta$ is the primary source of error. By restricting $\\beta=0$, we reduce estimation variance. We accept minor finite-sample bias to avoid imputing a static zero, which would introduce measurement error for these active firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Tier 3: Static Intensity (Low Information) for $N < 50$.**\n",
    "    For firm–sessions with fewer than 50 events (including \"Phantom Firms\"), we assign a static intensity of zero ($\\hat{\\lambda}=0$).\n",
    "    * **Justification:** Below this threshold, the likelihood surface is too flat to reliably distinguish dynamic clustering from noise. These firms are retained in the panel to correct for the extensive margin (existence of news) but do not contribute dynamic intensity variance.\n",

    "#### 1.2.3 Selection equation and probit specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Having constructed the news-intensity estimator, we formally specify the selection vector. Let $I_{j,k,y}^s$ be an indicator that firm $j$ and topic $k$ appear in the outcome panel in year $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection covariates vector $w_{j,k,y-1}^s$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{j,k,y-1}^s = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ I_{j,k,y-1}^s \\\\ \\lambda_{j,y-1}^s \\\\ \\ln(\\text{MarketCap}_{j,y-1}) \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $I_{j,k,y-1}^s$ is the lagged selection indicator (topic \"stickiness\").\n",
    "* $\\lambda_{j,y-1}^s$ is the lagged firm-year-session news intensity from the ACD model.\n",
    "* $\\ln(\\text{MarketCap}_{j,y-1})$ is the lagged natural log of firm market capitalization, sourced from our equity panel (`equity_regression_panel`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a standard probit specification with a latent selection index:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J_{j,k,y}^s = \\gamma_s^{\\prime} w_{j,k,y-1}^s + v_{j,k,y}^s, \\quad v_{j,k,y}^s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{j,k,y}^s = \\mathbb{1}\\{ J_{j,k,y}^s > 0 \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By including Market Cap, we explicitly model the \"Index Survival\" constraint. A firm with low market cap in $y-1$ has a higher probability of dropping out of the S&P 500 (and thus our dataset) in year $y$, regardless of its news intensity. The probit allows these two forces—news generation and index survival—to jointly determine observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.4 Inverse Mills ratio and selection correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the usual Heckman-style assumptions (joint normality of the\n",
    "selection error $v^s_{j,k,y}$ and the outcome error, and mean independence\n",
    "of $u^s_{j,k,y}$ given $w^s_{j,k,y-1}$), the selection bias can be summarised\n",
    "by an inverse Mills ratio term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For observed cells with $I^s_{j,k,y} = 1$ we form\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat m^s_{j,k,y}\n",
    "  = \\frac{\\varphi\\!\\left(\\hat\\gamma_s^\\top w^s_{j,k,y-1} \\right)}\n",
    "         {\\Phi\\!\\left (\\hat\\gamma_s^\\top w^s_{j,k,y-1} \\right)},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\varphi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal PDF. Intuitively,\n",
    "$\\hat m^s_{j,k,y}$ measures how “surprising” it is that the cell remains\n",
    "selected, given its lagged inclusion status and lagged news intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second-stage topic-persistence regression we will include\n",
    "$\\hat m^s_{j,k,y}$ as an additional regressor. Under the Heckman\n",
    "framework, this removes the component of the outcome error that is\n",
    "correlated with the selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.5 Sample Attrition and Exogeneity Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure data quality, we filter the raw universe of S&P 500 firms. We distinguish between attrition mechanisms that are plausibly orthogonal to the news-return process (safe to drop) and those that are endogenous (required for the selection correction).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Exogenous Attrition (Listwise Deletion)**\n",
    "We exclude specific observations where data quality compromises the entity resolution or return calculation. We contend that these exclusion criteria satisfy the condition of mean independence with respect to the outcome error term:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entity Resolution Ambiguity:** Firms with names acting as common nouns (e.g., \"Target\", \"News Corp\", \"Best Buy\") are excluded if they generate excessive false positives in the news collection pipeline. We assume the linguistic properties of a firm's name are orthogonal to its fundamental news-return dynamics.\n",
    "* **Vendor Data Gaps:** Firm-days with missing pricing data from the vendor (EODHD) are excluded. Given that we condition on S&P 500 constituency (active, solvent firms), we assume these sporadic gaps represent random technical ingestion errors rather than informative signals of financial distress (e.g., trading halts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Endogenous Attrition (Imputation and Modeling)**\n",
    "Attrition mechanisms plausibly correlated with firm fundamentals are handled explicitly to avoid selection bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Missing Market Capitalization:** Occasional gaps in the market capitalization record (e.g., due to vendor feed interruptions) are **not** dropped, as listwise deletion here could correlate with corporate actions or volatility. We impute these values via forward-filling (carrying forward the last known market cap), relying on the high persistence of firm size.\n",
    "* **Zero-News Firms (\"The Zeros\"):** Firm-years with zero identified news articles are **retained** in the first-stage probit estimation. These observations constitute the $I^s_{j,k,t}=0$ category. Excluding them would truncate the dependent variable of the selection equation, rendering the Heckman correction impossible. These firms are only excluded from the second-stage (persistence) regression *after* their contribution to the Inverse Mills Ratio has been calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Universe Conditioning**\n",
    "Throughout, we restrict attention to the S&P 500 universe. The selection process is therefore defined as the joint probability of S&P 500 inclusion (proxied by Market Cap) and news existence (proxied by News Intensity).\n"
