    "# Topic Coherence for LDA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook computes topic coherence scores for a set of MALLET LDA runs trained on a\n",
    "CC-NEWS–based corpus stored in Postgres. The goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interpretability diagnostics.** Use coherence (primarily the $C_v$ measure from Röder\n",
    "   et al., “Exploring the Space of Topic Coherence Measures”) as a *diagnostic and reporting\n",
    "   tool* for topic interpretability, and as a **secondary tie-breaker** among LDA runs that\n",
    "   already look similar in out-of-sample regression performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metadata persistence.** Persist per-topic metadata – top terms and coherence scores –\n",
    "   into the relational schema (`lda_topic_metadata` and `lda_article_topic_exposure`)\n",
    "   for downstream regression, labeling, and qualitative inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow Röder’s decomposition of coherence into four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segmentation** $S$: which word subsets we compare (e.g., all word pairs drawn from\n",
    "  the top-$N$ terms of a topic).\n",
    "- **Probability estimation** $P$: how we estimate word and co-occurrence probabilities\n",
    "  from a reference corpus (here: boolean sliding windows over cleaned news text).\n",
    "- **Confirmation measure** $M$: how strongly one subset supports another (e.g., NPMI).\n",
    "- **Aggregation** $\\Sigma$: how we fold many confirmations into a single topic-level\n",
    "  score (e.g., averaging over all pairs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The $C_v$ measure used here is realized via Gensim’s `CoherenceModel`, which instantiates\n",
    "this $S, P, M, \\Sigma$ framework with a specific configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is split into four stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Corpus sampling and cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sample article IDs from Postgres, aligned to trading days and sessions.\n",
    "   - Draw a **bounded random subsample** of articles (up to a configurable `subsample_size`)\n",
    "     from this ID set to serve as the reference corpus for coherence.\n",
    "   - Apply the same deterministic, multi-stage normalization and token canonicalization\n",
    "     pipeline used to build the LDA training corpus.\n",
    "   - Return a cleaned list of tokenized documents in the format expected by\n",
    "     `CoherenceModel(texts=...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-word extraction per topic and run**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Load MALLET topic–word weight dumps (`K200_*.parquet`).\n",
    "   - For each run and topic, extract the top-$N$ terms by weight in the order MALLET\n",
    "     emits them.\n",
    "   - Build a `List[List[str]]` per run in the exact format expected by\n",
    "     `CoherenceModel(topics=...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coherence estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each run, instantiate `CoherenceModel` with\n",
    "     `topics` = that run’s top-word lists,\n",
    "     `texts` = the cleaned reference corpus from Stage 1, and\n",
    "     `dictionary` = a Gensim word-to-id `Dictionary` built from the same corpus.\n",
    "   - Compute per-topic coherence scores and aggregate summaries (e.g., mean coherence\n",
    "     per run) as interpretability diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Persistence to Postgres**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each `(run_id, topic_id)` pair, write top terms and $C_v$ coherence into\n",
    "     `lda_topic_metadata`.\n",
    "   - For each `(run_id, article_id, topic_id)` triple, write topic exposures and a\n",
    "     corpus version into `lda_article_topic_exposure`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Corpus sampling and cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The coherence computation needs a **reference corpus** that is consistent with the one used to train the LDA models. Rather than re-implementing a second cleaning stack, we reuse the same functions that produced the tokenized parquet chunks and `FrequencyCounters` for LDA ingestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Sampling article IDs by trading day and session\n",
    "\n",
    "We first select a set of article IDs over a `[start_date, end_date]` window using `sample_corpus_per_day`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function queries the `trading_calendar` table for all rows with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `trading_day BETWEEN start_date AND end_date`, and  \n",
    "  - `is_trading_day = TRUE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each trading day, it iterates over both **“overnight”** and **“intraday”** sessions, and for each `(day, session)` pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Pulls `article_id`, `language_confidence`, and `full_text` from `parsed_news_articles`.\n",
    "  - Passes that day/session slice into `sample_per_day_session`, which applies:\n",
    "    - **Boilerplate removal** via `NOISY_PREFIXES` (reject articles whose `full_text` starts with a known noisy prefix).\n",
    "    - **Substring exclusion** via `NOISY_SUBSTRINGS` (reject articles containing well-known noise snippets).\n",
    "    - **Language-quality filtering**: require `language_confidence ≥ STRONG_ENGLISH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The result is a **deduplicated set of article IDs** that pass basic quality filters across all trading days and sessions in the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `sample_id_set` is the input to `extract_clean_corpus`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Fetching raw text and chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "`extract_clean_corpus` then materializes the raw articles and prepares them for cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It issues a single SQL query against `parsed_news_articles`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT *\n",
    "   FROM parsed_news_articles\n",
    "   WHERE article_id = ANY(%(samples)s)\n",
    "   ORDER BY RANDOM()\n",
    "   LIMIT %(limit)s;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "with `params={\"samples\": list(sample_id_set), \"limit\": limit}`. Notice that we only take a subsample of the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After loading into a DataFrame, it calls `.drop_duplicates(subset=[\"full_text\"])` to remove repeated content that survived the earlier filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To keep memory use bounded, it processes the data in batches of size `CHUNK_SIZE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for start in range(0, len(filtered_sample_df), CHUNK_SIZE):\n",
    "       end = min(start + CHUNK_SIZE, len(filtered_sample_df))\n",
    "       corpus_chunk = filtered_sample_df.iloc[start:end].copy()\n",
    "       cleaned_corpus_chunk = extract_cleaned_corpus_chunk(corpus_chunk, logger)\n",
    "       cleaned_corpus.extend(cleaned_corpus_chunk)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function returns a `cleaned_corpus` object with type:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   List[List[str]]  # one list of stemmed tokens per article\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is exactly what will be passed as `texts=` into `CoherenceModel` later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Multi-stage normalization and token canonicalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Each batch goes through `extract_cleaned_corpus_chunk`, which wraps the full deterministic cleaning pipeline used for the LDA training corpora:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization and tokenization** – `normalize_and_tokenize_sample`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Upstream, all article text is stored uppercased; normalization assumes **uppercase ASCII**.\n",
    "   * Non-alphanumeric characters are stripped using a regex.\n",
    "   * The normalized text is split on whitespace into `raw_tokens`.\n",
    "   * The DataFrame is **exploded**, so each row corresponds to a single token (`article_id`, `raw_tokens`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token-type classification** – `extract_token_types`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each token is classified into one of:\n",
    "     * `alphabetic` (letters only),\n",
    "     * `numeric` (digits only),\n",
    "     * `alphanumeric` (mixed).\n",
    "   * Encoded as an integer `token_key ∈ {1, 2, 3}` and a human-readable `token_type` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Numeric canonicalization** – `canonicalize_numerical_tokens_coherence`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Numeric tokens are converted to a numeric value and bucketed into magnitude classes based on configuration constants `BIL` and `MIL`:\n",
    "     * `bil` for values ≥ `BIL`,\n",
    "     * `mil` for `MIL ≤ value < BIL`,\n",
    "     * `num` for values < `MIL`.\n",
    "   * This change occurs since MALLET internally changes the representation given in the original cleaning process for numerical tokens (e.g. `__NUM__`)\n",
    "     to lower case and removes the underscores. Thus, for probabilities to be properly calculated withing the coherence model run, numerical values where normalized to fit the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alphanumeric cleanup** – `canonicalize_alpha_numeric_tokens`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For tokens labeled `alphanumeric`, all digits are stripped (`[0–9] → \"\"`), leaving only the alphabetic portion.\n",
    "   * Other token types are left untouched.\n",
    "   * This step cleans up IDs, tickers, and mixed alphanumeric noise without completely discarding the lexical content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stemming and stop-word removal** – `stem_and_remove_stop_words`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses NLTK’s English `SnowballStemmer`:\n",
    "     * Numeric tokens bypass stemming and adopt their canonical numeric form.\n",
    "     * Alphabetic/alphanumeric tokens are lowercased and stemmed.\n",
    "   * A stemmed English stop-word list is constructed (`stemmer.stem(word)` for each NLTK stopword).\n",
    "   * Rows whose `stemmed_tokens` fall in the stemmed stop-word set are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final token filtering** – `clean_corpus`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Drops tokens shorter than `MINIMAL_CHAR_COUNT_PER_TOKEN`.\n",
    "   * Drops any tokens that still contain digits after the earlier steps.\n",
    "   * The resulting DataFrame contains clean, canonicalized `stemmed_tokens` ready for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Re-aggregation to article level**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Finally, tokens are grouped back to document level:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     filtered_sample_df.groupby(\"article_id\")[\"stemmed_tokens\"].apply(list).tolist()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This yields a `List[List[str]]` chunk, which `extract_clean_corpus` extends into the global `cleaned_corpus` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Relationship to the LDA training pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions above are the **same primitives** used in the separate “corpus exploration and cleaning” notebook to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write tokenized parquet chunks (`tokenized_corpus_chunk_*.parquet`) under `TOKENIZED_PARQUET_DIR`.\n",
    "* Build `FrequencyCounters` (`token_frequency_counter`, `token_document_counter`, and the document-level counters) for ingestion into:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `lda_documents`\n",
    "  * `lda_vocabulary`\n",
    "  * `lda_document_terms`\n",
    "\n",
    "For coherence, we do **not** recompute frequency counters or parquet; we simply reuse the cleaning logic to construct an in-memory `cleaned_corpus` reference. This keeps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The LDA training pipeline,\n",
    "* The document–term matrices, and\n",
    "* The coherence probability estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "all aligned to the same tokenization and pruning rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections of the notebook we will take MALLET’s topic–word weight outputs, extract per-topic top terms, and feed those together with `cleaned_corpus` into Gensim’s `CoherenceModel` to obtain $C_v$ scores, which are then stored into `lda_topic_metadata`."

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Why use the $C_v$ measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Röder et al. decompose topic coherence into four design choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segmentation $S$** – how we break a topic’s top tokens into subsets (e.g., all\n",
    "  word–pair or one–vs–set combinations).\n",
    "- **Probability estimation $P$** – how we estimate word and co-occurrence\n",
    "  probabilities from a reference corpus (e.g., boolean sliding windows).\n",
    "- **Confirmation measure $M$** – how we tie together the segmentation choice and probabilities\n",
    "  to measure how strongly one subset supports another (e.g., normalized pointwise mutual information, NPMI).\n",
    "- **Aggregation $\\Sigma$** – how we fold many confirmations into a single score\n",
    "  (e.g., averaging over all pairs / subsets).\n",
    "\n",
    "The $C_v$ measure is one particular $(S, P, M, \\Sigma)$ choice that Röder et al. found to\n",
    "align best with human judgments of topic quality across multiple corpora:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It builds **context vectors** from boolean sliding windows over the reference\n",
    "  corpus, so co-occurrence statistics come from “which words tend to appear\n",
    "  near which other words” rather than from raw document counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the **one–set segmentation**, each topic is treated as a set of top\n",
    "  words, and for every word in that set the method compares two context\n",
    "  vectors: one for the singleton word and one for the whole topic set. The\n",
    "  strength of association in each coordinate is based on an NPMI\n",
    "  confirmation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It then applies a **similarity measure between these context vectors**\n",
    "  (cosine similarity in the $C_v$ configuration) and averages the resulting\n",
    "  scores over the topic’s top words to obtain a single per-topic coherence\n",
    "  value $C_v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, $C_v$ delivers the highest correlation with human-rated topic coherence among\n",
    "the measures Röder et al. test, and it is widely used as an automatic proxy for how\n",
    "interpretable a topic’s word list is to a human reader. In this notebook we treat $C_v$\n",

    "### 3.2 Computational trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of $C_v$ is that it is **computationally heavier** than simpler measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It requires building a dictionary and scanning the entire cleaned corpus with a\n",
    "  sliding window to estimate co-occurrence statistics.\n",
    "- Each topic’s score is computed from multiple one-to-set comparisons, so the cost\n",
    "  grows with both the number of topics and the chosen top-$N$.\n",

    "the four $K = 200$ MALLET runs used in this project. At a high level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All runs are in the same ballpark.** Mean and median coherence values are tightly\n",
    "  clustered around $\\approx 0.47$ for all four seeds, with similar dispersion\n",
    "  ($\\text{std} \\approx 0.13–0.14$). There is no single run whose topics are\n",
    "  systematically more or less coherent than the others.\n",
    "- **The left tail captures junk topics, not model collapse.** Each run exhibits a small\n",
    "  tail of low-coherence topics (minima in the $\\approx 0.17–0.23$ range), which correspond to\n",
    "  boilerplate or highly heterogeneous word lists. This is expected in large topic\n",
    "  models on news corpora.\n",
    "- **No coherence-based winner.** Because the distributions overlap heavily, coherence\n",
    "  alone does not justify promoting one seed over another. From a model-selection\n",
    "  perspective, coherence is acting as a *veto* (ruling out obviously pathological\n",
    "  runs) rather than an optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the broader project, **final model choice is driven by out-of-sample regression and\n",
    "trading performance**. Topic coherence plays a supporting role:\n",
    "\n",
    "- as an **interpretability diagnostic**, giving a scalar summary of topic quality that\n",
    "  can be reported alongside predictive metrics;\n",
    "- as a **sanity check** that all candidate LDA runs produce reasonably coherent topics;\n",
    "- and as a **tie-breaker** when multiple runs have similar predictive performance but\n",
    "  differ in how much probability mass they allocate to clearly junk topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata we persist below (`top_terms`, `cv_coherence`, and per-article exposures)\n",

    "\n",

    "- experiment with excluding low-coherence topics from the regression design matrix,\n",
